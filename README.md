		<h1><a name="Mind Game"></a>The Forex Mind Game</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The concept of trading is time-immemorial. This has brought about utilizing different
		approach to trading where indicator was designed and tool adopted to facilitate profit in 
		a short period of time as the case may be. <br /> But there were certain unknown factor that
		plays on the mind of each individuals involved.</p>
		<h2>The pattern of trading</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>There are many pattern where traders look for trend in the pattern they see. As a result,
		they make trading decisions until profit is in sight. <br /> Knowing fully well, this decisions
		must conform to the norms where the big player in the Game tend to move trend quicker and faster.</p>
		<h3>Long & Short Trade</h3>
		<p>When we talk about trading, we often use the expressions “long” and “short” to classify two types of trades. 
		It can be confusing to understand exactly what these terms mean, so in this article, I’m going to 
		explain everything you ever wanted to know about what “long” and “short” trades mean.<br /> Everything you ever wanted 
		to know about long and short trades but were afraid to ask… that’s the long and the short of it! No more jokes, I promise.</p>
		<h4>Simplest Explanations</h4>
		<p>The simplest way to classify “long” and “short” trades is to say that in any trade, 
		you are long of that from which you will profit if it rises in relative value, 
		and short of that from which you will profit if it falls in relative value.<br />
		For example, let’s say that you buy a stock of ABC Inc. with U.S. dollars. 
		It can now be said that you are “long” stock of ABC Inc. and “short” of U.S. dollars. 
		This is because for you to profit, the value of the ABC Inc. stock must rise against U.S. dollars, or 
		alternatively, the value of the U.S. dollar must fall against the stock of ABC Inc.</p>
		<a name="Long Trade"></a>The Short Trades
		<p>From the time of the Bretton Woods Agreements shortly after the end of the Second World War until 1971, the value of the U.S. 
		Dollar was defined as $35 per ounce of gold, and therefore effectively the “price” of the greenback was the same as the price of gold. 
		Most major economic powers agreed to fix the value of their own currency to that of the greenback. 
		In 1971 the U.S. began a series of devaluations of the greenback compared to the price of gold, before finally abandoning all linkage between the dollar and gold in 1976.<br />
		For this reason, there was very little Forex trading before the 1970s. Speculative traders instead focused on stocks and commodities. 
		Traders could make money by buying stocks and commodities cheaply and selling them at a higher price. 
		However, as traders wanted to find a way to profit when they thought that prices were about to fall, but didn’t already own any stocks or commodities to sell, the practice of going “short” arose. 
		Traders would go short of stocks or commodities by borrowing the stocks or commodities in question, and then selling them, before buying them back later at a hopefully cheaper price. 
		The stocks or commodities could then be returned to the loaner, and a profit taken from the difference between the original sale price and the buy-back price. 
		It should be noted that short sellers would have to pay interest on any money borrowed initially that was required to purchase the stocks or commodities to be sold.</p>
		<h4><a name="Long Trade"></a>Long and Short Forex Trades</h4>
		<p>In Forex, things are different, because whether you are making “long” or “short” trades, you are always long of one currency and short of another. 
		If you buy, or go long, EUR/USD for example, you are buying EUR with USD. 
		You are long EUR and short USD. If you sell, or go short, EUR/USD, then you are long USD and short EUR. It is really all the same.<br />
		For example, let’s say you go long EUR/USD. You have, at least theoretically, bought EUR with USD. If the inter-bank interest rate for USD is higher than it is for EUR, 
		your broker might be paying you some money each time you hold the position over the New York rollover time (i.e. daily). 
		This is because you are getting interest on your USD greater than the interest they are getting on the EUR, and in theory, positions are “squared” at every New York rollover. On the other hand, 
		if the interest rate on the currency you are long of is less than the rate for the currency you are short of, 
		you will be charged some amount representing the difference every day that the position is kept open.</p>
